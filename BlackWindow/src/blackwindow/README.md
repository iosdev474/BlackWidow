The Java application is a card game - BlackJack  
The game consists of one dealer and atleast one palyer (usually 2-7)  
It is a card comparision game where each player only competes against the dealer  
Game Player  
- Initially the dealer gives himself 2 cards and then 2 cards to each player  
- Each card has a value of its rank. Face Cards are 10 (Jack, Queen, King) and Ace is 11.
- Value of the hand is the sum of all the cards in the hand.  
- Players are allowed to draw more cards in order to increase their handValue  

Objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:  
- Get 21 points with first two cards  
- Reach final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21  
- Let the dealer draw additional cards until their handValue exceeds 21  

In case the handValue gets higher than 21, that player looses
